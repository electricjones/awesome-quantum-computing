# Kitchen Sink
The [README](README.md) is meant to be a highly selective, curated list of resources. The [learning-path](learning-path.md) is an attempt at a community-driven introductory path for people from various backgrounds.

The **Kitchen Sink** is meant to be "everything and the kitchen sink". A lightly sorted catch all of Quantum Computing resources, news, and insights. It started as my "clipped from the web" master list of everything quantum over the last 5 years.

This is a large list, but it still maintains some standards:
1. All resources must be **quality content**. Well researched, free of too many spelling errors and typos, and generally well-regarded.
2. Favor resources by **well-respected** entities. That could mean established news sources, working professionals, quality youtube explainers, or newcomers who have done the research and are producing quality content.
3. Include **divierse perspectives**, when the content meets the first two criteria. There is a lot of evolving discussion in the field. There are some validly critical voices. This is not meant to be an echo chamber, but a collection of resources.

All that said, understand that the following list is not as well-vetted as the other two. It is up to you to find the gold. Feel free to contribute.
